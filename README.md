# Geek Burger

_This project was designed to be implemented on a self-service totem pole of an imaginary fast food restaurant, Geek Burger, which has customers with dietary restrictions._

This project has already been prebuilt into jar files. The project was developed in Java 13, I don't know if it will run on older versions of Java.
To execute them you only need to enter this command line in your bash:
